## Aim

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works using AI models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Algorithm

1. Understand **prompt patterns** such as query decomposition, decision-making, answer engineering, fact checklist, tail generation, menu actions, and semantic filtering.
2. Select the **content type** (e.g., report, case study, article, or creative writing).
3. Frame **basic prompts** to generate initial drafts.
4. Refine prompts gradually using advanced patterns:

   * Add structure with **answer engineering**.
   * Extend narrative with **tail generation**.
   * Guide style and tone with **semantic filters**.
5. Generate and refine content iteratively.
6. Review outputs for coherence, creativity, accuracy, and tone.
7. Produce final polished content.

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Select Scenarios

Chosen Scenarios:

1. **Business Report on Market Trends**
2. **Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

### Step 2 – Apply Prompting Techniques

**Scenario 1: Business Report on Market Trends**

* *Simple Prompt:*
  “Write a report on global market trends.”
* *Refined Prompt with Query Decomposition & Semantic Filtering:*
  “Write a structured business report on 2025 global market trends focusing on three industries: renewable energy, electric vehicles, and AI-driven services. Include data-driven insights, challenges, and growth opportunities in a formal business tone.”

**Scenario 2: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

* *Simple Prompt:*
  “Write a sci-fi story.”
* *Refined Prompt with Tail Generation & Role-Based Context:*
  “Write a 500-word sci-fi short story set in the year 2140. The protagonist is an astronaut stranded on a Mars colony after communication with Earth fails. The tone should be suspenseful, with vivid descriptions of technology and survival struggles, ending with an unexpected twist.”

### Step 3 – Generate Multiple Versions

* Initial outputs created from simple prompts.
* Refined outputs created by applying decomposition, filtering, and tail generation.

### Step 4 – Compare Outputs

* **Simple prompts** gave general but shallow content.
* **Refined prompts** produced structured, detailed, and engaging outputs.

## Deliverables

1. **First Drafts:** Simple, general outputs from naïve prompts.
2. **Refined Content:** Detailed structured content using query decomposition and semantic filtering.
3. **Multiple Versions:** Demonstrated differences in tone, detail, and quality by varying prompt styles.
4. **Final Version:** Polished, coherent, and high-quality outputs tailored to specific scenarios.

---

## Conclusion

This experiment proved that **advanced prompt patterns significantly enhance content creation**. While simple prompts produce basic drafts, structured prompting techniques like query decomposition, tail generation, and semantic filtering improve coherence, depth, and creativity. Hence, effective use of prompting enables AI to generate professional-quality reports, engaging articles, and imaginative stories tailored to diverse needs. ✅
